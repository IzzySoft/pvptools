1) Intro
========

 These scripts are intended to automatic update some data in your phpVideoPro
 installation with information retrieved from the IMDB. You probably don't need
 any of them if you never ran a version less than v0.9.3 of phpVideoPro, and
 you probably don't need the get_movie_ids.php script if you never ran a version
 less than v0.8.2 of phpVideoPro - provided you always used the IMDB query window
 to retrieve all information, since it will just update the IMDB ID (where not
 set) and the rating (where not set) of the movies within your database.

 The scripts themselves make use of the phpVideoPro "libraries" to do their jobs.
 This means, for many things it uses the settings of the given installation,
 e.g. concerning the IMDB cache and the like. Furthermore, they of course need
 some IMDB libraries - which means you should have installed the IMDBPHP
 package (version 6.4.0 or higher) and it must be available via the include_path
 configured for your php-cli binaries.

2) WARNING
==========

 There are some warnings you should read first before running this script:
 1 - Don't run it against an installation with a version smaller than
     0.8.4 - it was never tested with those, even if it *may* run with the
     0.8.3 due to the data structures, it will break at best if you run it
     against a 0.8.2 or smaller, or may even destroy some data. So upgrade
     to at least v0.8.4 (or higher) first. get_name_ids will for sure break
     with any phpVideoPro installation less than v0.9.3 due to missing
     database structures.
 2 - If you cannot fix "false positives" in the database yourself, always
     make a "dry run" first (more about this later) to ensure there are none.
     Especially dangerous is the $write_yf setting, which you never should
     use in this case (also later more on this).
 3 - Before you run the script, go to your phpVideoPro web interface, log in
     as admin, go to admin->configure and check the IMDB settings that either
     caching is disabled or a valid cache directory is specified. Otherwise
     you may destroy parts of your installation.

5) Scripts included and how to use them
---------------------------------------

 Currently there are three scripts provided with this package:
 * get_movie_ids.php tries to update the movies with their corresponding
   IMDB ID
 * get_name_ids.php does the same for the crew members (i.e. actors, directors,
   composers)
 * backup.php is your CLI interface for backups and their restore
 * user.php is your CLI interface for the user management

 Before you start running them, consider the following:
 * get_name_ids.php depends on the fact that your movies already have the
   corresponding IMDB IDs set, and will only update crew members mentioned
   with such movies (this is to ensure we chose the correct people). So if
   you don't have the movie IMDB IDs stored into your database, make sure
   to run get_movie_ids.php first
 * as mentioned before, both scripts require phpVideoPro (at least v0.9.3)
   and IMDBPHP (at least v6.4.0) to be installed and configured.
 * Before running the scripts, please consult their corresponding documentation.
   You will for sure need to check their configuration, and have the advice
   concerning their special usage checked.
