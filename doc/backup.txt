1) Intro
========

 This text file only deals with things special to the PHP script with the
 same name. Please also read the pvptools.txt file for common information,
 including (but not restricted to) Copyright and Warranty.

 The backup script is intended to allow backups from the command line, e.g. to
 be regularly scheduled via cron. Backups are written to the standard output,
 i.e. you have to redirect the output to a file. Restore of course will read
 from the file specified, which must reside in the backup directory specified
 in your phpVideoPro configuration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Quick Intro for the Impatient
--------------------------------

 1 - Check the configuration inside the pvptools.config.php file and make the
     "dir" reflecting the base directory of your phpVideoPro installation
     and the "adminID" the id of the admin user
 2 - Run the script once without any parameters to see its syntax
 3 - Do your backups and restores

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Basics behind and probable cruxes
------------------------------------

 This script is intended to be run from the command line only (do not place it
 where it can be reached from other people, especially avoid storing it in your
 web tree), while it utilizes phpVideoPros API.

 This means two things: a) you need to have the PHP CLI (Command Line Interface)
 installed, and b) you need to have its php.ini set up correctly. With the
 defaults used there, the script will most likely abort with some "not enough
 memory" warning - so you need to increase the memory_limit in the php.ini
 first. For most installations, 24M will be a good choice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Usage for the Patient
------------------------

 This will basically be the same as for the impatient, just a bit more detailed.
 First thing you have to do is to adjust the configuration to match your
 installation. If you open the pvptools.config.php with your favorite editor, you
 will easily find the section marked "==[ Configuration ]==" - that's where you
 need to go. Better don't change anything outside this section if you're not
 familiar with PHP and don't know what you are doing ;)

 The first line of this section defines the directory where your phpVideoPro
 installation is to be found in. This is what you *must* adjust. This is
 followed by a line defining the ID of an administrative user in your phpVideoPro
 installation (who has permissions on all records) - usually this is the user
 named "admin". To find out the corresponding ID, log into your phpVideoPro
 installation as administrative user, and look the ID up in Admin->Users.
 The third line specifies whether to "clean" the DB before doing a movie
 restore, i.e. drop all movie records first. If set to FALSE, all movies from
 the given backup file will be "appended", i.e. created as new records.

 So far for the configuration. If you now run the script once without
 specifying any parameters, it will tell you its syntax. As it is with backups,
 there are basically two modi: backup and restore. So we will explain both here:

 To create a backup, you will need a couple of command line parameters:
 1 - the name of the installation you configured above
 2 - the literal word "backup"
 3 - what you want to backup: "movie", "sysconf", or "cats"
 Now keep in mind that everything is written to the standard output, so you
 need to redirect the output to a file in order to store the backup. An example
 call could look like this:

 ./backup.php demo backup movie >movies_2009-05-12.pvp

 For a test if everything works, better take something smaller (e.g. "sysconf")
 and do not redirect the output. If you see regular error messages, something
 went wrong. But if you see undefinable binary stuff, it probably worked :-)

 For a restore, things look a bit different. First, the file will be read from
 disk, and need to reside within the backup directory specified in your
 phpVideoPro configuration. Next, the backup type (movie, sysconf, cats) will
 be automatically detected. Which leaves us again with three parameters:
 1 - the name of the installation you configured above
 2 - the literal word "restore"
 2 - the name of the file (without path) to restore from

 So again, an example could look like that:

 ./backup.php demo restore movies_2009-05-12.pvp

 Now you either get error messages, or the restore succeeded.
