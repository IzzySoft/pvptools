History of pvptools
===================

v0.4
-----------------
! users.php: Passwords have been screwed up (double-md5)
* renaming pvptools.config.php to pvptools.config.php.sample to avoid overwrite on updates
* make get_movie_ids.php working with recent IMDBPHP
* backup, user: use full PHP open tag instead of short_tag

v0.3 (16.02.2009)
-----------------
+ added script for backup and restore
+ added script for user management
* moved the configuration from all scripts to pvptools.config.php, so there's
  only one place for the user to edit - which also eases updates

v0.2 (23.01.2009)
-----------------
+ added script to retrieve the person IMDB IDs for the crew members
* due to changes in phpVideoPro (e.g. database), the movie ID script had to be updated
* changed the name of the movie ID script to make its purpose more clear
+ added Makefile for easy installation (and packaging)

v0.1 (16.01.2007)
-----------------
* first public version, one script to retrieve the IMDB movie IDs
